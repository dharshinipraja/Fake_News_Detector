#  Fake News Detection using Machine Learning & NLP

This project is a Machine Learning-based Fake News Detection system built using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **NLTK**. It classifies news articles as **real** or **fake** using natural language processing techniques such as **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Passive Aggressive Classifier**.
